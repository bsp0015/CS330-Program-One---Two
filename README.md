# CS330-Program-One---Two
This is a program that demonstrates movement behaviors and path following for my AI and Game Development Course.
The code in main.cpp is for both a Dynamic movement behavior assignment as well as a path following assignment. PA1 code is commented out at the bottom of the code; however.
